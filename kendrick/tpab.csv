Are you deceiving me? Could I let you down easily, is your heart where it need to be? Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime? Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line? If I’m tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car Would you judge me a drug-head or see me as K. Lamar Or question my character and degrade me on every blog Want you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you’re very welcome You tell me my song is more than a song, it’s surely a blessing But a prophet ain’t a prophet til they ask you this question:   When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

Like who got your best interest? Like how much are you dependent? How clutch are the people that say they love you? And who pretending? How tough is your skin when they turn you in? Do you show forgiveness? What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended? What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing? What kind of bridge did they burn? Revenge or your mind when it’s mentioned? You wanna love like Nelson,  you wanna be like Nelson You wanna walk in his shoes but you peacemaking seldom You wanna be remembered that delivered the message That considered the blessing of everyone This your lesson for everyone, say   When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

See I got to question it all, family, friends, fans, cats, dogs Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow Murphy’s Law, generation X, will I ever be your X? Floss off a baby step, mauled by the mouth of Pit bulls, put me under stress Crawled under rocks, ducking y’all, it’s respect But then tomorrow, put my back against the wall How many leaders you said you needed then left ‘em for dead? Is it Moses, is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red? Is it Martin Luther, JFK, shoot or you assassin Is it Jackie, is it Jesse, oh I know, it’s Michael Jackson, oh   When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? That nigga gave us Billie Jean, you say he touched those kids? When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?   The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it Let my word be your earth and moon you consume every message As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression And if you riding with me nigga, let me ask this question nigga"
