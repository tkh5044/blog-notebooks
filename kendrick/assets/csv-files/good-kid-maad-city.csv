She said ""Down the street from Dominguez High"" Okay, I know thats borderline Compton or Paramount ""Well is it Compton?"" ""No,"" she replied and quickly start batting her eyes and Strictly had wanted her thighs around me Seventeen, with nothing but pussy stuck on my mental My motive was rather sinful ""What you trying to get into?"" She didnt tell, just gave me her Nextel Dropped the number, we chirped the whole summer and well   The summer had passed, and now Im liking her Conversation we having probably enticing her Who could imagine, maybe my actions would end up wifing her Love or lust, regardless, well fuck cause the trife in us Its deep rooted, the music of being young and dumb Is never muted; in fact, its much louder where Im from We know a lot bout each other, her mother was a crack addict She live with her granny and her younger two brothers Her favorite cousin Demetriuss irrepetible Family history of gang banging - did make me skeptical But not enough to stop me from getting a nut I wanna come over, whats up?

"good kid, m.A.A.d city",sing-about-me-im-dying-of-thirst,"Part 1 - Sing About Me     When the lights shut off And its my turn to settle down My main concern Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me I said when the lights shut off And its my turn to settle down My main concern Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me   I woke up this morning and figured Id call you In case Im not here tomorrow, Im hoping that I can borrow A peace of mind, Im behind on whats really important My mind is really distorted, I find nothing but trouble in my life Im fortunate you believe in a dream This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine And last night was just another distraction or a reaction Of what we consider madness, I know exactly what happened You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel Like everything was alright and a fight he tried to put up But the type of bullet that stuck had went against his will As blood spilled on your hands, my plans rather vindictive Everybodys a victim in my eyes When I ride, its a murderous rhythm and outside became pitch black A demon glued to my back whispering, ""Get em"" I got em, and I aint give a fuck That same mentality that told my brother not to duck In actuality, its a trip how we trip off of colors I wonder if Ill ever discover a passion like you and recover The life that I knew as a youngn in pajamas and dun-ta-duns When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs Dumb niggas like me never prosper Prognosis of a problem child, Im proud and well devoted This piru shit been in me forever So forever Imma push it, wherever, whenever And I love you cause you love my brother like you did Just promise me youll tell this story when you make it big And if I die before your album drop, I hope (gunshots)   Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me I said when the lights shut off And its my turn to settle down My main concern Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me   You wrote a song about my sister on your tape And called it Section.80, the message resembled ""Brendas Got a Baby"" Whats crazy was, I was hearing about it But doubted your ignorance how could you ever just put her on blast and shit Judging her past and shit, well, its completely my future Her nigga behind me right now asking for ass and shit And Imma need that forty dollars even if I gotta Fuck, suck and swallow in the parking lot Gonzales Park, Im followed by a married man, a father of three My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinkling keys Matter of fact, he my favorite cause he tip me with Es He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week This is the life of another girl damaged by the system These foster homes, I run away and never do miss em See, my hormones just run away and if I can get em back To where they used to be then Ill probably be in the denim Of a family gene that show women how to be woman Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin Then you probably need to beat her, thats how I was taught Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed And Im exhausted, but fuck that ""Sorry for your loss"" shit My sister died in vain, but what point are you trying to gain If you cant fit the pumps I walk in? Ill wait Your rebuttal a little too late And if you have a album date, just make sure Im not in the song Cause I dont need the attention bring enough of that on my own And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great? A doctors approval is a waste of time, I know Im straight Ill probably live longer than you and never fade away Ill never fade away, Ill never fade away, I know my fate And Im on the grind for this cake, Imma get it or die trying Im eyeing every male gender with intentions of buying You lying to these motherfuckers, talking about you can help em With my story, you can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga Dont ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga...   When the lights shut off And its my turn to settle down My main concern Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me I said when the lights shut off And its my turn to settle down My main concern Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me   Sometimes I look in a mirror and ask myself: Am I really scared of passing away? If its today, I hope I hear a Cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon With the holy ghost til it drown in the blood of Jesus I wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline Reeking the scent of a reaper, ensuring that my allegiance With the other side may come soon, and if Im doomed May the womb help my mother be blessed for many moons I suffer a lot, and every day the glass mirror Get tougher to watch; I tie my stomach in knots And Im not sure why Im infatuated with death My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats That can come about, ’cause the tongue is mighty powerful And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch Maybe cause Im a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death Really stuck in the schema of wondering when Imma rest And youre right, your brother was a brother to me And your sisters situation was the one that pulled me In a direction to speak of something thats realer than the TV screen By any means, wasnt trying to offend or come between Her personal life, I was like, ""It need to be told"" Cursing the life of twenty generations after her soul Exactly whatd happen if I aint continued rappin Or steady being distracted by money, drugs, and four- Fives, I count lives all on these songs Look at the weak and cry, pray one day, youll be strong Fighting for your rights even when youre wrong And hope that at least one of you sing about me when Im gone Am I worth it? Did I put enough work in?   Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me I said when the lights shut off And its my turn to settle down My main concern Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me  (Promise that youll sing about me forever Promise that youll sing about me for-ooooh) Promise that youll sing about me forever Promise that youll sing about me for-ooooh Promise that youll sing about me forever Promise that youll sing about me for-ooooh   (On the phone:)  ""Nigga, the homies brother-- nigga, right here, he gone, my nigga, he gone!""
