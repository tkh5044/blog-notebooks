untitled unmastered,untitled-01-08192014," Come here, girl Oh, you want me to touch you right there? Oh, like a little lamb, play in your hair Oh you want it? Oh you want it right now Like that? I got you baby All on you baby Push it back on daddy Push it back on daddy baby   I seen it vividly jogging my brain memory, life is... I seen it vividly jogging my brain memory Life no longer infinity this was the final calling No birds chirping or flying, no dogs barking We all nervous and crying, moving in caution In disbeliefs our beliefs the reason for all this The tallest building plummet, cracking, and crumbling The ground is shaking, swallowing young woman With a baby, daisies, and other flowers burning in destruction The smell is disgusting, the heat is unbearable Preachers touching on boys run for cover, the paranoid Rapists and murderers hurdle alleys Valleys and high places turn into dust Famous screaming in agony Atheists for suicide, planes falling out the sky Trains jumping off the track, mothers yelling ""hes alive"" Backpedaling Christians settling for forgiveness Evidence all around us the town is covered in fishes Ocean water dried out, fire burning more tires out Tabernacle and city capital turned inside out Public bathroom, college classrooms been deserted Another trumpet has sounded off and everyone heard it (Its happening) no more running from world wars (Its happening) no more discriminating the poor (Its happening) no more bad bitches and real niggas Wishing for green and gold the last taste of allure I swore I seen it vividly A moniker of war from heaven that play the symphony Thunder like number four, then I heard ""What have you did for me"" I fell to my knees, pulled out my resume That dated back to June 17th, 1987 My paperwork was like a receipt I was valedictorian, I was fearful of judgment But confident I had glory in all my past endeavors Close my eyes, pray to God that I live forever Dark skies, fire and brimstone, some of us sent home Some of us never did wrong but still went to hell Geez Louise, I thought you said that I excel I made To Pimp a Butterfly for you Told me to use my vocals to save mankind for you Say I didnt try for you, say I didnt ride for you I tithed for you, I pushed the club to the side for you Who love you like I love you? Crucifix, tell me you can fix Anytime I need, Imma start jotting everything in my diary Never would you lie to me Always camaraderie, I can see, our days been numbered Revelation greatest as we hearing the last trumpet All man, child, woman, life completely went in reverse I guess Im running in place trying to make it to church   Young nigga act an ass Young nigga act a fool Young nigga get yo cash Young nigga do what it do Young nigga go, young nigga go Young nigga go, young nigga go Whatever makes all of you happy in this bitch Just take it all back before the light switch"

untitled unmastered,untitled-03-05282013," So I met this young lady, ya know, when I went back home. I was tryna spit my best game to her, you know, give her my best cap, but she kept on snapping her fingers like *snaps*. I said ""You know what, girl? You crazy."" Then she asked me what he said...   (What did the Asian say?) ""A peace of mind"" Thats what the Asian said—I need a divine Intervention was his religion and I was surprised Him believing in Buddha, me believing in God Asked him what are you doing, he said ""taking my time"" Meditation is a must, it dont hurt if you try See you thinking too much, plus you too full of yourself Worried about your career, you ever think of your health? (What did the Indian say?) ""A piece of land"" Thats what the Indian said—I needed the man Telling me longevity is in the dirt Should buy some property first Should profit a better dollar with generational perks Equity at his best, really, you should invest These tangible things expire, dont you expect Income with so much outcome and yes Look at my heritage, we blessed (Now, what the black man say?) ""A piece of pussy"" Thats what the black man said I needed to push me To the limit, to satisfy my hunger We do it all for a woman from haircut to a war We like to live in the jungle, like to play in the peach What you saying to me? He said ""nigga, come back to reality for a week"" Pussy is power, fuck on a new bitch every night I wouldnt be prouder, you should allow it (What the white man say?) A piece of mines Thats what the white man wanted when I rhyme Telling me that he selling me just for $10.99 If I go platinum from rapping, I do the company fine What if I compromise? He said it dont even matter You make a million or more, you living better than average You losing your core following, gaining it all He put a price on my talent, I hit the bank and withdraw Hit the bank and withdraw, hit the bank and withdraw Put myself in the rocket ship and I shot for the stars Look at what you accomplished and what he said to the boy ""Imma make you some promises that you just cant ignore Your profession anonymous as an artist If I dont target your market If you aint signing your signature when I throw you my wallet A lot of rappers are giving their demo all in the toilet Your world tour, your masters, mortgage, I need a piece""     I holler, ""What you do? What you say?"" I shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if I get freed today I holler, ""What you do? What you say?"" I shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if I get freed today   What the black man say? Tell em we dont die, tell em we dont die Tell em we dont die, we multiply Tell em we dont die, tell em we dont die Tell em we dont die, we multiply Tell em we dont die, tell em we dont die Tell em we dont die, we multiply Tell em we dont die, tell em we dont die Tell em we dont die, we multiply"
untitled unmastered,untitled-04-08142014," They say the government mislead the youth, youth, youth, youth (Tell em when you went to the park and everybody came back and...) And welfare dont mean well for you, you, you, you (What about when you tried to do a side for that but you...) They tell me that my bills past due, due, due, due (Talk about the charge you got...) And preacher man dont always tell the truth, truth, truth (Do you believe in God? If you dont, its cool)   (But) head is the answer, head is the future Dont second guess yourself (Dont tell them when you second guess yourself I need you in the kitchen now I forgot...) Come on give me some help, yeah Head is the answer, head is the future   Dont second guess yourself Come on, give me some help And I just wanna And I just wanna Straight up Eyes with my head And I cant use some help Straight up   Head is the future"
untitled unmastered,untitled-05-09212014," Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal Drowned inside the lake outside away you flow And that means the world to me And that means the world to me And that means the world to me And that means the world to me Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal Drowned inside the lake outside away you flow And this I know   I got 100 on my dash, got 200 in my trunk Name in the grab bags, put my Bible in the trunk Taaka vodka on the top of my binocular Im drunk How come I can make them popular, pop em when I want See Im livin with anxiety, duckin the sobriety Fuckin up the system I aint fuckin with society Justice aint free, therefore justice aint me So I justify his name on obituary Why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart? Once upon a time I used to go to church and talk to God Now Im thinkin to myself, hollow tips is all I got Now Im drinkin by myself, at the intersection, parked Watch you when you walk inside your house You threw your briefcase all on the couch I plan on creeping through your fuckin door and blowin out Every piece of your brain until your son jump in your arms Cut on the engine, then sped off in the rain Im gone   Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal Drowned inside the lake outside away you flow And that means the world to me And that means the world to me And that means the world to me And that means the world to me   Drove alone, with a bottle of his own grippin the handle Lit off henny, Im tryna dismantle These wicked ways, Ive engaged in such a gamble Cause I could speak the truth and I know the world would unravel, wait Thats a bit ambitious maybe Im trippin Maybe Im crazy, maybe I exist in a different dimension Not to mention when I close my eyes I see the distance Its such a scary sight so I rarely go to sleep at night I watch the sun rise then I watch the sun fall Studied the son of God but still dont recognize my flaws I guess Im lost, the cost of being successful is equal to being neglectful I pray my experience helps you As for me Im tryna sort it out Searching for loopholes in my bruised soul But who knows? I just need a little space to breathe I know perception is key, so I am king   The other side has never mortified my mortal mind The borderline between insanity is father time I fall behind my skeleton, they tell me that Im blind I know that Im intelligence, my confidence just died Carpe diem, seize the day, I cant compromise A tape worm couldnt cure this gluttonous appetite A couple trinkets, they seein me as I pacify But couldnt fathom the meaning of seein sacrifice Im passin lives on a daily, maybe Im losing faith Genocism and capitalism just made me hate Correctionals and these private prisons gave me a date Professional dream killers reason why Im awake Im sleep walkin, Im street stalkin, Im outta place Reinforcing this heat barking, these are the brakes Before I blink do I see me before them pearly gates? Or this is just a mirage or a facade Wait"

untitled unmastered,untitled-08-09062014," Why so sad? Walking around with them blue faces She said I’m down on my luck And it’s something I gotta have Blue faces I hit the bank today and told them color me bad Blue faces Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey   Two tears in the bucket I cry with you But I could never lie with you I could never afford not to afford I could never put my plans to the side with you I could never see a red light Like a deer with a headlight I freeze up when I re-up See I barely have patience And youre relating Only the moment to complete us Why you hate to work for it? The reason I never went to work for it See a nine to five was so jive turkey But when Thanksgiving came that check didn’t hurt me You plead the fifth I read the Fifth Amendment We both criminals with bad intentions They say time heals all But if I can shortcut My success, Corvettes by tomorrow Wait a minute!   Now, why you so sad? Walking around with them blue faces She said I’m down on my luck And it’s something I gotta have Blue faces I hit the bank today and told them color me bad Blue faces Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey   My home girl got a credit card scam She got a scholarship to college but she don’t give a damn Intuition she got a broke bitch wishin She tell me this on the phone with the noodles in the pan I know you, woman, I console you, woman You feel like the universe owes you, woman Oh the anticipation, of hoping you could make it Bitches dont prosper chasing education But youre talented, and cant handle it And your homegirls cant be your manager 365 times four, plus more If yant get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina? But shit, aint no money like fast money Even today Im considered a crash dummy A rapper chasing stardom, how can I fast forward? My accolades better than all them   Why you so sad?

Walking around with them blue faces She said I’m down on my luck And it’s something I gotta have Blue faces I hit the bank today and told them color me bad Blue faces Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey   Pimp pimp hooray"
