The shock value of my success put bolts in me All this money, is God playin a joke on me? Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job? Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before? At 27, my biggest fear was losin it all Scared to spend money, had me sleepin from hall to hall Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin 30 shows a month and I still wont buy me no Lexus What is an advisor? Somebody thats holdin my checks Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt? I read a case about Rihannas accountant and wondered How did the bad girl feel when she looked at them numbers? The type of shitll make me flip out And just kill somethin, drill somethin Get ill and fill ratchets with a lil somethin I practiced runnin from fear, guess I had some good luck At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein judged How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city What they say bout me reveal If my reputation would miss me What they see from me Would trickle down generations in time What they hear from me Would make em highlight my simplest lines   Im talkin fear, fear of losin creativity Im talkin fear, fear of missin out on you and me Im talkin fear, fear of losin loyalty from pride Cause my DNA wont let me involve in the light of God Im talkin fear, fear that my humbleness is gone Im talkin fear, fear that love aint livin here no more Im talkin fear, fear that its wickedness or weakness Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth And I cant take these feelings with me So hopefully they disperse Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax Searchin for resolutions until somebody get back Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth And I cant take these feelings with me So hopefully they disperse Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax Wonderin if Im livin through fear or livin through rap   Damn Goddamn you Goddamn me Goddamn us Goddamn we Goddamn us all   Verse two says you only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities. So until we come back to these commandments, until you come back to these commandments, were gonna feel this way, were gonna be under this curse. Because he said hes gonna punish us, the so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians, are the true children of Israel. We are the Israelites according to the Bible. The children of Israel, hes gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience, because we chose to follow other gods that arent his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee. So, just like you chasten your own son, hes gonna chastise you because he loves you. So thats why we get chastised, thats why were in the position were in. Until we come back to these laws, statutes and commandments, and do what the Lord said, these curses are gonna be upon us. Were gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live here in today, in the United States of America. I love you, son, and I pray for you. God bless you, shalom."
